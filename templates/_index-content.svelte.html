            <p>Nearly 8-in-10 eligible Minnesotans voted in this week's historic presidential election, reaching numbers not seen in 60 years and retaining its status as a top-voting state, made largely possible by enthusiasm among both parties and record-shattering numbers of absentee ballots cast during a pandemic.</p>

            <p>Minnesota's highest turnout rate during a presidential year since the end of World War II was in 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower won reelection, one of the few times the state has landed in the Republican column and drawn voter involvement beyond 80 percent. The last time Minnesota's voter turnout reached 79 percent was John F. Kennedy's presidential election win in 1960.</p>

            <p>This year's high-stakes election saw this extradinarily high turnout deliver a big win for Democratic candidate Joe Biden over President Donald Trump and some very close races downballot as well.</p>

            <p>Absentee balloting, which started six weeks prior to the election and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/x/572588741/">shattered early voting records</a>, played a huge roll in driving voter engagement this year, with most counties seeing half or more of their turnout coming from advanced ballots submitted before Election Day.</p>

            <p>Over the 2.1 million absentee requested by Minnesotans, 1.8 million were returned and accepted, representing about 56 percent of the record 3.2 million total Minnesota ballots cast in this election.</p>

            <p>Some counties saw greater surges in voter turnout than others compared to 2016, with heavy DFL areas like Hennepin and Ramsey seeing boosts in voter engagement that helped propel decisive Democratic wins in statewide contests. Yet it was counties like Carver, Washington and Scott in the Twin Cities metro area suburbs that represented the highest turnout rates in Minnesota this year, another signal of significant suburban mobilization.</p>

            <p>Turnout was up all across the country, with Joe Biden claiming the presidency with more than 75 million votes nationwide, and President Donald Trump garnering more votes than an incumbant president ever has with more than 71 million.</p>

            <p>Current estimates show Minnesota narrowly leading every other state in voter turnout, once again securing a status that has long distinguished Minnesotans as a state boasting high levels of civic engagement among its residents.</p>
